          Before reno started, I delivered some pastries & a note to the immediate neighbours beside and one level down to let them know reno was starting soon🍩🗒️

          💡 Pull-out Baskets
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          If you plan to have pull-out/pull-down baskets in your kitchen cabinet, these need to be sent to the workshop (before the fabrication of the kitchen cabinet).
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The carpenter would then be able to get the correct measurements to achieve a perfect fit for the kitchen cabinet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          After some research & checks with Philip, I bought my sink & my pull-out/pull-down baskets from this brand called Higold (悍高五金官方旗航店) on Taobao.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Subsequently, I decided to add on another pull-out basket for cutleries & went for a different brand called Eacha (意驰旗航店).
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          So I had one piece of Eacha and five pieces of Higold products.
          </p>
          <img

          />
          <p className="text-[15px] italic pb-[16px] pt-2 text-center max-w-[500px] mx-auto font-poppins">
          Sent the various kitchen cabinet baskets to the workshop for detailed measurements.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          My verdict 👨‍⚖️
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          i. The Higold sink is very nice. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But the problem is it uses a bottle trap of a different size (China variant). Which meant I could not change it to the white plastic PVC type we are accustomed to here in Singapore. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Thankfully, Philip checked and feels Higold’s bottle trap is of good quality & should not spoil anytime soon.
          </p>
          <img
          className='mx-auto max-w-[730px] w-full' 
            src='/Assets/COMMENCEMENT/Higold-bottle-trap.webp'
            alt="thankyou"
          />
          <p className="text-[15px] italic pb-[16px] pt-2 text-center max-w-[500px] mx-auto font-poppins">
          Higold’s bottle trap.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Nevertheless, I went ahead and bought another set of bottle traps and piping from Higold as a spare.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          ii. Higold’s pull-out baskets (for drawers) are nice too. But they are designed without a piece of backing to secure the basket. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          When you pull the Higold pull-out baskets, they feel a bit loose even though they are secured.
          </p>
          <img
          className='mx-auto max-w-[730px] w-full'

          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          iii. Higold’s pull-down & the corner pull-out baskets are fine too! 
          </p>
          <img
          className='mx-auto max-w-[730px] w-full'

          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          iv. There is no “loose” issue with the Eacha pull-out basket as it has a backing to secure the basket. 
          </p>
          <img
          className='mx-auto max-w-[730px] w-full'

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I assume the rest of Eacha’s baskets are like that, too. If given a 2nd chance, I might choose all my baskets from Eacha instead.  
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          However, Eacha does not sell kitchen sinks. In terms of price point, both brands are probably around the same price.

          💡 Ceiling Fans
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I chatted with the fan installer Ah Xiong, who came to install the KDK fans. He had installed many different brands of ceiling fans but not that many KDK fans.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Out of curiosity, I asked him why 🤨
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          He shared that many sales guys push other brands because of higher commission payout. KDK does not pay as well.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          In his opinion, KDK fans aren’t the cheapest. But they are probably the most reliable. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Also, this may be important to you: the light coming out from the side of the KDK’s light case produces a very mild strobe effect. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[12px] font-bold  max-w-[730px] ">
          💡 Direction of Floor Tiles
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          If you are using longish floor tiles (we used them for the kitchen), you may want to position them so that people will walk across rather than along them. Walking across the tiles (instead of along) will help to minimise slipping accidents.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[12px] font-bold  max-w-[730px] ">
          💡 Vinyl Flooring & skirting
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          If you are going for vinyl flooring, you may think that the skirting material your ID/contractor is going to use will be the same as the vinyl flooring.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Sounds logical, right?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Wrong.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Some IDs/contractors may opt to go for wood skirting slapped with veneer, which is cheaper than using the actual vinyl for the skirting.  
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Such wood skirting is also less lasting (will split) when compared to actual vinyl skirting. And when it comes to the skirting installation, the cheaper & easy way is to nail them to the wall.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The more laborious but appealing way is to glue them piece by piece. So make sure to check what skirting & installation method you are getting.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I had zero knowledge until the installation of the vinyl flooring was done 😅
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Lemett laid the vinyl flooring while Philip took care of the skirting. I commented to Philip that the flooring and skirting look sibeh swee and well done.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          That’s when he told me he had taken various measurements to give to the vinyl guys to cut up the vinyl material into pieces of skirting. The wall was prepped & smoothened by Philip before he pasted the skirting.
          </p>

          I saw a post recently where one member asked whether it’s normal to have exposed wood at the drawer’s base (facing the floor).
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          To me, it sounds logical not to have coloured PVC at the drawer’s base. I mean… who will squat down or lie on the floor to look at the drawer’s base? 🤭
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But I can understand why some homeowners would want it for a consistent look and feel. Leave no stone unturned.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          After reading that member’s post, I squatted down to look at my completed cabinets out of curiosity. So what lies beneath?

          Oh yeah! Coloured PVC beneath my drawer!

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Coloured PVC. I didn’t even ask for it. Not that I’m complaining 🙂
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          If this matters to you, do talk to your ID/contractor about it. This brings me to my next point…
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[12px] font-bold  max-w-[730px] ">
          💡 I Thought. He Thought. Who Confirm? 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Other than material selection, there were probably several other things that I didn’t discuss in detail with Philip because I assumed that there was only one way to do it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But in fact, there may be multiple ways to do it. Take, for example, the LED lighting under the kitchen cabinet. I told Philip I wanted to have LED lighting under the kitchen cabinet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          In my mind, I just assumed it would be one continuous stripe of LED lighting from the extreme left, passing by the cooker hood and then to the extreme right.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But Philip did two stripes for me – on both sides of the cooker hood. There was nothing where the cooker hood was. Hmmm… not bad too… but not what I had in mind. 
          </p>
          <img
          className='mx-auto max-w-[730px] w-full' 
            src='/Assets/COMMENCEMENT/new-kitchen-cabinet.webp'
            alt="thankyou"
          />
          <p className="text-[15px] italic pb-[16px] pt-2 text-center max-w-[500px] mx-auto font-poppins">
          Two lines of LED look all right, too!
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          My wife thought two stripes looked better than one. It didn’t matter to my mum. And so we left it alone. I got lucky as this was the only “I thought, he thought” moment for me. Reading through what some homeowners experienced, there could easily have been a lot more such instances. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Don’t tempt lady luck. Talk through everything with your ID/contractor.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          P.S.1. I didn’t ask Philip why he did two instead of one. My guess is if he did one, the cooker hood would have protruded out more.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          P.S.2. The electrician was particularly impressed with the housing Philip created in the kitchen cabinet to put the LED driver properly. I knew nothing about the LED driver or the housing. He mentioned most IDs/contractors tend to #anyhow place the LED driver. Some even enclose the LED driver, which is a serious NO NO.
          </p>
          <img
          className='mx-auto max-w-[730px] w-full' 
            src='/Assets/COMMENCEMENT/LED-driver.webp'

          />
          <p className="text-[15px] italic pb-[16px] pt-2 text-center max-w-[500px] mx-auto font-poppins">
          Proper housing for the LED driver.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          So, if you are running an LED light in your kitchen cabinet, remember to ask how the LED driver will be stored.

          💡 Installation Order
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Different people may have different views about the installation order. Philip wanted all the lights, ceiling fans, & aircon fan coils installed upon completing the wet works. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          After which, the vinyl guys would come in to install the vinyl flooring. I was hesitant because I thought these items would catch dust & may interfere with the painting. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The electrician felt the same way, too. But Philip reasoned that by installing these items first, there would be no fear of heavy things dropping (during their installation) onto the vinyl floor.
                    </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          If things were to drop during the installation process, these things would be falling onto the old flooring instead of the vinyl floor. Fortunately, or unfortunately, he was proven right ✅
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The electrician’s assistant drilling the ceiling light dropped the drill onto the floor from the ladder 😱
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Thankfully, the vinyl flooring hadn’t been installed when that happened. As a bonus, I didn’t have to pay extra for cardboard protection with this order..
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Not that I didn’t want to buy them. But Philip talked me out of it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          He placed the empty vinyl boxes in areas on the new vinyl flooring that might need extra protection from the painting work. On his own accord, he also kept all the packaging boxes from the pull-down/pull-out baskets/sink/laundry rack and reused them for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Can save, save. Can reuse, reuse.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          That’s what he always suggests. Would you like to save some money?

          💡 Kitchen Sink
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I thought I had gotten the correct dimensions for the under-mount kitchen sink. The dimensions looked right when I looked at the measuring tape 📏
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But I somehow missed the fact that the kitchen sink I chose had a few cm of “flat surface” near the tap area. This meant the actual open area of the kitchen is narrower than I thought.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          When the counter-top was applied, the kitchen sink was only left with a width of 32cm. 32cm is too narrow to place a wok into the sink to wash as most woks start from 30cm without factoring in the handles. 
                    </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I didn’t even realise this until I invited my mum to have a look at her new kitchen, and she asked me, “why the sink like that?” 🤦‍♂️
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Please do not make this same mistake as me. The kitchen sink at my place is about 45cm. #sian #MumNotHappy

          💡 Taobao Shipping Sequence
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          This section is a snapshot of what I shared recently in Taobao Addicts when someone asked for advice regarding Taobao/reno logistics.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          a) Batch One
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside text-[17px] ml-4 '>
            <li>all the lightings </li>
            <li>some bathroom/toilet fixtures & fittings </li>
            <li>kitchen sink + pull out/down baskets</li>
            <li>auto laundry rack</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] pt-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          Before I purchased the pull out/down baskets, I checked with Philip to see if what I wanted to buy could realistically fit the kitchen layout. I had them delivered to my place instead of my mum’s place before reno started.
                    </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Upon completing the wet works, I sent the kitchen sink, pull out/down baskets & hood/hob to the carpentry workshop so that Philip could design the kitchen cabinet around these items’ dimensions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Based on my observations in my mum’s case, items from batch 1 needed to arrive by the completion of wet works at the latest. Philip told me I had to finalise the design and measurements of the carpentry work once the wet works were completed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          If the ID/contractor you are engaging has many different parties handling different works, then batch one may have to arrive earlier.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          b) Batch Two & subsequent batches
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          As mentioned earlier, I bought all the furniture & a large number of various accessories from Taobao. These started arriving in different batches shortly after the renovation work was completed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I had to stagger these shipments because I had no manpower to uncrate so many things in one go. I also didn’t want to inconvenience the new neighbours by having so many packages along the corridor.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          You can skip this part if you have no interest in knowing more about Philip’s background. During the reno, I always looked forward to chatting with Philip at the flat 💬
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Through our conversations, I found out Philip is cross-trained & skilled in various aspects of renovation work. As a youth in Malaysia, he studied how to be an electrician & sold tiles in a tile shop. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          After coming to Singapore in the 80s, he continued to sell tiles and did wet works initially. And then, he picked up carpentry skills along the way before finally having the opportunity to own a carpentry workshop 🪵🪚
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Philip is now a fellow Singaporean.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Philip is a very hands-on person who likes to tinker with things. He is a craftsman who takes pride in his work and isn’t a sales and marketing guy. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          He even helped me to tune a newly purchased bicycle. At one point, he was contemplating opening a LBS. 🔧🚲
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I also discovered that both Philip & the electrician (makes macarons & kueh lapis) are excellent cooks 👨‍🍳👨‍🍳 Both of them have a deep understanding of cookware & bakeware. I’m gonna miss the chit chat sessions.
