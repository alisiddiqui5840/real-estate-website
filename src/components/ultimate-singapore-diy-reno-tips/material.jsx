          I was very impressed with the services rendered by the sales lady @ LSH, Hui Shing. She was proactive, friendly and helpful 👍

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          From a service perspective, Hui Shing was outstanding. She approached me enthusiastically the moment I stepped in to ask if she could help. So I showed her photos of the type of tiles I was interested in & she immediately went about picking out the ones with the closest match.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Subsequently, she also took the initiative to gather and line up all the tiles I shortlisted without being asked. That helped me to visualise the various combinations and how the tiles would look under different lighting 🔦🧱

          When I completed the shortlisting, the sample tiles were taped together in different combinations (with markings) so that they would be easier for me to reference later when I needed to make a decision. Wonderful! 🥇

          EDL has a beautiful showroom that they use to showcase full piece laminates. An EDL consultant was assigned to “take care” of me when I visited (I made an appointment first) 👨‍🏫

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          After a quick chat to find out what I was looking for, the consultant showed me all the laminates I had shortlisted and recommended some others for my consideration. When viewing the full piece laminates, the helpful consultant also explained their subtle differences to me.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Over at Evershine and Lam Chuan, it was essentially a DIY session 🔧

          The customer experience wasn’t as sleek as what I experienced at EDL. I was left alone to flip through the catalogue (perfectly fine with that).

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Lam Chuan also had full piece laminates that you could ask to see.

          Over at Evershine, I didn’t ask to see any full piece laminates because I didn’t find anything suitable.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          In the end, we decided to go with Lam Chuan’s soft, solid matte anti-fingerprint laminate (we need to top up $$) for the kitchen and one of the marble laminates for the bedroom wardrobes.

          P.S. I really really liked EDL’s Brown Bolzano Elm (DWC 3655AT) but didn’t find a use case for it. I remarked to the consultant how beautiful it was. And the consultant smiled and said, “I’m using that for my own home.” 🙂✌️

          Recently, a Budget Reno member did the turmeric test on <span className='font-bold'>polished white Laminam samples</span>. These samples failed the stain test.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Laminam’s care guide states that polished Laminam surfaces aren’t as resistant to stains compared to matte Laminam surfaces. Not sure how this matte black Laminam that I chose for my mum will fare with turmeric.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Anyway, the installer told me to use thinner to wipe off stubborn stains. Do take note if you are considering going with Laminam.

          Previously, I had more or less decided to get something from <a target='blank' href="https://www.hddoor.com.sg/" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline text-[#123774]   hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[17px]">HDDoor</a> after visiting them when once again, through a post in Budget Reno, I got to know about <a target='blank' href="https://www.zansan.sg/" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline text-[#123774]   hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[17px]">Zansan</a>. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          That was when I found out that besides carrying popular brands like other digital lock sellers, Zansan sells brands exclusive to them, like Bosch & Zeus (Korean) 🔐
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Upon further reading, I was particularly interested in Bosch digital locks as they came with the features I sought. And with three years warranty. I’m not sure if there is any other digital lock brand that offers three years warranty in Singapore.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I visited Zansan’s Gambas Crescent sales office (since shifted to Balestier) and was lucky to be attended to by another super helpful & patient staff by the name of Samantha 🥇
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          To my pleasant surprise, Samantha shared that Zansan sold doors and gates, too – at very competitive prices. After a thorough explanation by Samantha, I went for the Bosch EL600 door lock & Zeus Z3G gate lock. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">

          On the day before the locks were due to be installed, Samantha told me they would upgrade my Zeus gate lock to a Hafele GL5600 because they were running a campaign. Complimentary. 👏👏

          I’m going slightly off track to talk about Song Cho kitchen appliances. I had never paid much attention to them. Only found out recently that they do FB Live almost every Wednesday afternoon.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          During these FB Live sessions, the Song Cho guy (Daniel / 大牛) will do live demos using their various kitchen appliances. In Mandarin. Customers with questions related to their kitchen appliances can call 62811198 to talk to their product person to seek clarification anytime before 7pm. Daily 👍👍👍
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The access to a product expert and the Facebook Live sessions is a huge draw, especially since my mom is Chinese-ed. With help just a call away, it would be much easier for her to learn how to use the new appliances I was getting for her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          As a result, from not planning to get any Song Cho kitchen appliances, we changed course and got the air fryer (with the rotating mechanism), rice cooker, pressure cooker & salad maker from them. Now, my mom can call up Song Cho anytime she needs help understanding how to meddle with the settings.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          BTW, Song Cho runs ad-hoc special promos for their kitchen appliances on & off during these FB live sessions. I got great deals from these sessions.

          First Aircon’s pricing isn’t the cheapest. But I have known this company for a while as I have engaged them multiple times for work purposes. Their quality of work (& providing the right advice) is more important to me.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I don’t think they have much online presence as they run their biz primarily by word of mouth. Don’t go for them if you are after the cheapest quote. However, if you want to receive the right advice & proper installation with good materials, you may want to consider them.

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Are you feeling lost or fearful because you have never shopped on Taobao? 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But you would like to learn & try?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          A good starting resource is the FB group, <a target='blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/164667577528140" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline text-[#123774]   hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[17px]">Taobao Addicts</a>. Many helpful members in there. Just like Budget Reno. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          A couple of months back, a Singaporean Malay member in Taobao Addicts clocked 6.5cbm (cubic metre) worth of goods even though he doesn’t know Chinese 💪💪💪
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          He chatted directly with the sellers using Google Translate instead of buying through a buying platform like Ezbuy. #salute
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Here are three suggestions for Taobao newbies: 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          a) If you are buying big, bulky items, tell the seller, “运出国外，麻烦加固包装”. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Essentially asking the seller to provide extra protection and make sure items are wrapped properly. Be warned – they could still end up poorly wrapped 😅
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But if you buy from responsible & well-rated sellers, they will take the extra effort to wrap appropriately. And maybe provide wooden crating at no additional cost.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          b) When chatting with the sellers using the chat feature, remember always to ask, “可以再优惠一些吗？”. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          This phrase means whether the price can be more attractive. Especially good to ask this question during periods when there’s no promo or promos have ended. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Sometimes, they will tell you they will give you the same promo price. If you don’t ask, you don’t get it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          c) Since one of the major perks of shopping on Taobao is cost savings, be sure to activate Shopback before you checkout to get yourself some cashback. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          However, do note that Shopback doesn’t apply to all products.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I have gotten as high as 10% cashback for some items. The rest are mainly between 1% to 3%.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          P.S. I will briefly touch on my Taobao shipping sequence in the next section.
