          One day, Philip was painting the utility room while I was in the living room waiting for the digital lock installer to show up. Suddenly, it started raining heavily ⛈️
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          And then Philip ran out of the flat 🏃‍♂️
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          When he returned, I asked him what happened.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          While painting the utility room, he noticed that the neighbouring unit had clothes hanging outside 👕👚
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          So when the rain came suddenly, he ran to inform my mum’s new neighbour to keep his clothes. #KampongSpirit
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          That’s the helpful person Philip is – someone with excellent skills, knowledge and a character to match. It is my good fortune that I found Philip in Budget Reno & managed to engage him to be my main contractor.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   max-w-[730px] ">
          The three months’ wait for him was worth it 👍🤝🙏
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   max-w-[730px] ">
          Would I recommend him to someone looking for a contractor? Of course! 💯
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But perhaps not for everyone. The following is what I think 👇
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Philip could be a good match for you if the following points describe you & your situation:
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          📐 you are not in a rush to get started or complete the reno 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          📐 you are not looking for someone to propose fanciful themes (proposing & executing are two different matters)
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          📐 you know exactly what you want & need a contractor to execute
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          📐 you are looking for a dependable, responsible & skilled contractor (that does not charge exorbitant rates)
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          📐 you do not need quick responses to messages; i.e., ok to receive replies the next day (please call for urgent matters)
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          📐 you are not looking to do full reno for a landed property (he doesn’t have enough manpower – at least at the point of this post)
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          📐 you do not need any 3D rendering
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          If the above describes your situation or you aptly, then I think the chances of you having a v.happy reno with Philip will be very high 🥳
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Having said all the above, I’m sure there are plenty of equally capable (or even better) contractors (& IDs) in Singapore💪
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          You only need to find the one that is right for your home & you. One easy way is by posting in Budget Reno asking for a recommendation. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I’m sure you’ll receive many good recommendations from other members. Read & choose wisely.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But if you make an effort to search deeper using the search feature, you may uncover hidden gems… 💎😉
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I would not have discovered Philip if I did not click the search button.
          </p>  <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Btw… this contractor that I engaged doesn’t owe me any favour. I’m not his 恩公 (benefactor) So, even if you quote my name when you contact Philip, he will not give you any special price or discount. 😆😅
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I’m sure you get what I’m trying to say 😉
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          One last thing. When everything was settled, I took up Sompo’s home insurance. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          They are one of the rare ones that offer “new for old cover” (no depreciation of your contents) & have the “all risks” option.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Good luck & I wish you all the best with your reno! ㊗️☘️

          ‼️ NOTE ‼️ 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          👉 In case you are even wondering, this is not a sponsored post. Philip is already super busy with ZERO online presence. Likewise, any shop or company mentioned in this post.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          👉 In fact, Philip will most likely disappoint you by telling you he doesn’t have the bandwidth. I know he is now midway through a condo reno & about to start on a HDB & another condo reno soon. Be prepared for #rejection. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          👉 If you are not in a rush, be nice and show you sincerely would like to enlist his help. I think it would help.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          👉 Just because I enjoyed an excellent experience with Philip does not necessarily mean it will turn out the same way for you.
