          My mum bought a 40+-year-old HDB resale flat (2 bedrooms + 1 toilet + 1 bathroom) in an old & original condition late 2020.

          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          This top floor unit came with pink floor and wall tiles, extremely uneven walls & ceiling (slightly slanted), terrazzo flooring, a tired-looking bedroom wardrobe & an old kitchen cabinet.

          I did reno for my place many years ago and had been entirely out of touch with what was happening in the reno scene.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          With my mum slated to receive the keys to her flat on 30 Dec 2020, I started the reno journey by attending a <a target='blank' href="https://renovate.qanvast.com/hangout/" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline text-[#123774]   hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[17px]">Qanvast hangout</a> in early Dec 2020.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          At the event, my wife & I got to meet four different IDs, and we shared the following requirements with them:
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ overlay vinyl flooring in the living & two bedrooms
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ overlay kitchen floor tiles
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ hack living & kitchen dividing wall
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ hack & redo toilet/bathroom
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ hack & install a new L-shaped kitchen cabinet (glass backsplash, quartz counter-top)
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ hack & install new casement wardrobe in 1 bedroom
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ change a new set of windows in living room & 1 bedroom
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ plastering of wall & ceiling
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ✅ painting
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
            🎨 white, grey, black, brown colour theme
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          💰 $30k budget
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          Fairly straightforward stuff. Nothing fanciful or complicated.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[730px] ">
          I also planned for the following but did not include them as part of the main reno cost.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ☑️ new system two aircon
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ☑️ new ceiling fans with light
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]    max-w-[730px] ">
          ☑️ new electrical wirings/sockets
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          ☑️ new main door/gate with digital locks
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The expectation was to start the reno after CNY 2021.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[20px]  mb-[12px] font-bold text-[#123774] max-w-[730px] ">
          (A) MEETING WITH IDs
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Out of the four IDs we met, one gave me a $40k++ quotation on the spot.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The other three did not talk so much about the cost but took down my requirements and said they would get back in one to two weeks with an appointment to discuss further.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Out of these three, two did not get back as promised, while the last one cancelled our appt at the last minute. The sole ID that gave me the $40k++ quote was the only one who followed up with me.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I then decided to check out how this $40k++ quote differed from carpentry companies (found on FB) that did full-scale reno.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[20px]  mb-[12px] font-bold text-[#123774] max-w-[730px] ">
          (B) MEETING WITH CARPENTRY COMPANIES
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I visited three carpentry companies (all in Woodlands) that also do full-scale reno.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I also contacted a 4th carpentry company over WhatsApp.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Out of the four, two of them came down for a site visit on New Year’s Eve, right after my mum picked up the keys for the flat.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Generally speaking, the quotations from these four carpentry companies were between 5% to 15% cheaper than the sole ID quote I received.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          These quotations suggested that I couldn’t do what I wanted to with a budget of $30k.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The most expensive component was the hacking and tiling work in the toilet & bathroom which amounted to close to $8k (the cheapest quote).
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Plastering work was around $4k (also from the cheapest quote).
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Their carpentry cost was reasonable since they all have their roots in carpentry and did not need to outsource.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          However, none of the four carpentry companies followed up with me after they provided me with their initial quotations 📵
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The lack of follow-up from the IDs and carpentry companies probably reflected the state of things then (COVID-19)—too much work, too few workers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Or perhaps the value of my mum’s reno project was just too small for them to be seriously interested. No hard feelings.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The 4 Qanvast IDs:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside text-[17px] ml-4 '>
            <li>Interior Times</li>

          The 4 carpentry companies:

            <li>White Artz</li>

          <p className="text-[20px] pt-[32px] mb-[12px] font-bold text-[#123774] max-w-[730px] ">
          (C) MEETING WITH CONTRACTOR PHILIP SIM
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          While researching which carpentry company to approach in December 2020, I found <a target='blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/457538531061839/posts/1415632815252401/" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline text-[#123774]   hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[17px]">a post by Wong Zi Qin</a> in the group. She shared her wonderful renovation experience with contractor Philip of Yong Ping Renovation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          2 things from the post stood out.
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside text-[17px] ml-4 '>
            <li>Philip set high standards for his work</li>
            <li>Philip gave practical advice not driven by profits </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[17px] mt-[32px] mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Unfortunately, I could not find anything else about Yong Ping Renovation or Philip online other than her post. But I decided to contact him anyway in mid-December 2020.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          However, he turned me down immediately as he said he was too busy & did not have time to take on new projects 👎👎
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I told him there was no rush, and the reno could start three months later, in March 2021, if that helped. With the revised start date, he said, “OK, keep in touch…” 🤣
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The moment we received the keys to the flat, I followed up with him to check if he could come down for a look-see. In early January 2021, Philip visited the flat for a site visit. During that site visit, he came across as someone approachable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Equally conversant in both English & Mandarin (& I suspect Malay too because he grew up in Malaysia), from the questions Philip asked and the answers he gave me, it seems he is a very hands-on guy who knows how to many aspects of reno work himself 🛠️📐✏️
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The others typically said, “let me check“. But not Philip. He gave assured answers on the spot. Not bad.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          His quotation arrived one week later 📥
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Like a true blue contractor, the quotation did not look as sleek or polished as the others I received. That hardly mattered to me thought.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          In a way, it was good that the quotation did not look overly polished. It looked authentic. I looked through the quotation carefully. And had a shock 😲
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          At $22k, this was way lower than any of the other quotations I received. Seriously?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          As a reminder, the quote was purely for reno related work and excluded electrical works, AC installation & replacement of a new main door/gate (with digital locks).
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          To get to know Philip better (& also answer some questions I had), I visited his Tampines workshop the following Sunday morning. That trip turned out to be an eye-opening session 💡
          </p>
          <img
          className='mx-auto max-w-[730px] w-full' 
            src='/Assets/Reno/visit-to-workshop.webp'
            alt="thankyou"
          />
          <p className="text-[15px] italic pb-[16px] pt-2 text-center max-w-[600px] mx-auto font-poppins">
          Visit to Yong Ping Reno. Don’t let the nondescript affect your judgement.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Philip took the time to show (the work in progress carpentry works) & explained to me the various carpentry, renovation & practical considerations. That chat demonstrated his experience and expertise. One example was our discussion about the backsplash.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          I told him I wanted to use a crystal clear glass backsplash instead of the one with the green tint. He warned that the glass backsplash could crack over time with “the wrong usage” if there is an electrical socket nearby.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          When pushing the electrical appliance plug into the electrical socket, he said some people (esp older folks) have this habit of giving the plug an extra “knock” or a final hit.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          They behaved as if the plug would not go in entirely without this extra hit. Done repeatedly over time, the glass backsplash might crack 💥💥💥
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Philip had seen many such cases over the years. His comment immediately rang a bell with my wife & me as we had witnessed this kind of “extra hit” before 🔔🔔
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          That caused me to rethink my choice to use a glass backsplash. I use a stainless steel backsplash at my place. No complaints about stainless steel as it is easy to maintain. But I wanted to get something with a different look for my mum’s place.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          The discussion went well & there was good chemistry. Without hesitation, I decided he would be the one to handle the reno for my mum’s flat.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          On a subsequent visit to his workshop, we also discussed kitchen counter-top materials and looked at some full piece laminates that he had ordered for his existing projects. He also suggested ways to keep costs low by tweaking existing things in the flat instead of going for an outright replacement. He doesn’t like wastage.
          </p>

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          By default, all his carpentry comes with,
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside text-[17px] ml-4 '>
            <li>ABS trimming for door panels</li>
            <li>soft closing mechanism (excel)</li>
            <li>internal colour PVC</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[17px] pt-[32px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          We agreed to a tentative start date of March 2021. However, he refused to take any deposit 💲💲💲
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          And there was no contract to sign 📜❌
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Without a deposit, I became worried that he would not have time for me at the last minute 😅
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          But I respected his decision 🤝
          </p>

          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] mt-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Philip’s standard payment schedule:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside  text-[17px] ml-4 '>
            <li>40% upon commencement of work on-site</li>
            <li>40% when carpentry installation starts</li>
            <li>20% upon reno completion </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-[17px] pt-[32px]  mb-[32px]  max-w-[730px] ">
          Philip is effectively the boss of a carpentry company that takes on full-scale reno. Like the carpentry companies, I had met earlier.
