          I first shared my experience renovating my mum’s newly purchased HDB resale flat in the <a target='blank' href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/457538531061839" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline text-[#123774]   hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[17px]">Facebook Group Budget Reno (Singapore)</a> around July 2021. It was my way of giving back to the group’s community, which had helped me so much.

          Unfortunately, a year later, Facebook AI wrongly flagged it as spam & removed it. Thankfully, I had written the post on my PC and kept a copy of it.

          That post benefited many group members. Reproducing it on my website in the hope it will benefit my readers, too.

          Any prices quoted in the post are likely no longer valid, and some vendors or product models may no longer exist. However, the principles or processes behind how renovation works are done are likely to remain unchanged.
