                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left">Jack sold our condominium in Bukit Timah at the worst of times in 2014 when prime residential property prices saw the sharpest decline as a result of the 15% ABSD. It was time-sensitive as we had to move to the UK.</p>
                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left"> He listened. He advised. His assessment of the market was top notch. Anything property related, I go to Jack for advice.</p>
                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left">Jack recently helped me rent out a different property for the first time. He priced it at a premium, and he managed to seal a two-year rental at a higher price than I was expecting!</p>
                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left">About Jack: I’ve dealt with property agents to know when I see an honest, trustworthy one. He is very knowledgeable of his business and very astute with ideas to meet market demands. His forte is your confidence in allowing him to handhold you from start to finish in getting the deal done.</p>

                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left">Some Singapore property agents bring in “quantity” – throngs of viewers for a unit up for sale or rental, only to end up with either zero deals or, worse, one with a compromised transaction. </p>
                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left">Jack Sheo ensures quality – he brings in property clients of a healthy calibre in ways more than one – friendly, trustworthy and credible.</p>
                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left">And when Jack says he would do his best to ensure that the deals are not closed below the mkt rate, he really did!</p>
                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left"> He keeps to his promises on due dates and meeting times and volunteers to run property-related errands without asking for anything in return. Thanks, Jack. You make property investment a more beautiful experience.</p>

                    <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]   text-left">Besides his work ethic & professionalism, we were heartened that Jack took time to understand our concerns, and then made sure they were met.</p>
