            Hey there!
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          I'm Jack, and I've got a question for you:
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            What's your biggest challenge or concern when it comes to dealing with property
            agents?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            I remember my reservations before I became an agent myself. I was worried about
            dealing with pushy, aggressive agents who seemed more interested in closing a deal
            than truly helping me. Friends had shared horror stories, and I braced myself for the
            worst.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            Thankfully, when I eventually started my house-hunting journey, it was nothing like I
            imagined. Although my encounters weren't horrible, they weren't spectacular either. I
            experienced moments when the property agents didn't seem interested, lost
            patience, or weren't quite sure of themselves.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            That's when a thought began to take root in my mind.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            "Can I be the kind of property agent I wished I had met?"
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            Someone who truly listens, puts the client's needs first, and goes above and beyond to
            make the process smooth and stress-free? Yes, I can.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            Almost immediately after thinking I could, I heard another voice.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            "Do you have sales experience?"
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            "Do you have a strong network to tap on?"
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            "Can an introvert succeed?"
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            "Can you really be a property agent?"
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
            Trust me. I became fearful & didn't believe I could.
          </p>
          <div className='border-l-4 border-[#2d3748] '>

            Just as a seed grows into a plant, every thought manifests into our
            reality.

          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          After the seeds were planted, I spent a few more years in the internet marketing department of a global MNC. When my wife had our first child & had to go on maternity leave, I decided to leave the IT industry to help her run her young Kumon centre.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          The few years I spent at Kumon influencing young minds were highly satisfying, even more so than my time in the IT industry. It reinforced my desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          However, I couldn’t see myself in a classroom forever.

          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          It was 2009, and my wife was back holding the fort at Kumon. While pondering what to do next, I thought back to the moments when I first considered becoming a different kind of property agent.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          You won’t believe what happened next.

          While doing research online, I chanced upon a property agent’s blog. What Kam Choo Choo wrote about <a target='blank' href="https://ganchau.blogspot.com/2009/07/excuse-meare-you-property-agent-8.html" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[#123774] hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] text-[17px]"> doing things professionally & ethically </a> resonated strongly with me. It felt like an unmistakable sign that I should join her. I reached out to her via email & asked to meet her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Before I go further, I need to share a remarkable chance encounter.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Way back in 2002, my wife and I visited Rialto, an Italian eatery at Amara Hotel. We were the last diners for the night. Towards the end of our meal, the lady boss came over to chat with us.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          I can no longer remember what we talked about, but we were hugely impressed by her genuine interest in how we were doing and how we found the food. In those brief 10 to 15 minutes, we could feel her genuine care for her diners. We never saw her again after that night.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Fast forward to my appointment with Kam Choo Choo on 17 November 2009. We had arranged to meet at a Dennis Wee Group career talk. When I saw her, I was shocked.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          She was the very same lady boss I met 7 years ago at Rialto!
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          This incredible coincidence only strengthened my conviction that I was meant to enter the real estate industry and learn from her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          If not now, when?
          </p>

          <p className="text-[20px] mb-[32px]  pl-[20px]">
          When we least expect it, life sets us a challenge to test our courage & willingness to change.

          Six years after I planted the seeds of thought, I finally took the plunge. With enthusiasm, I joined the real estate industry in January 2010, determined to be the change I wanted to see.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Did I become the change I wanted to see?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Yes. That was the easy part because I’m patient by nature. However, the business side of it was a very different story. Deals were hard to secure. I found myself face-to-face with the very fears that had initially given me pause.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Then something unexpected happened. Choo Choo was diagnosed with a severe illness & passed on not long after diagnosis.
