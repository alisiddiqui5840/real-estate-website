          The Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) is a debt servicing framework first introduced by the MAS in 2013 to ensure that borrowers do not take on more debt than they can afford to repay, and to help prevent a housing market bubble.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          It sets a limit on the amount of debt a borrower can take on based on their income and existing debts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Under the TDSR framework, a borrowerâ€™s total monthly debt obligations, including mortgage payments, cannot exceed 55% of their monthly income.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          For example, if a borrower has a monthly income of SGD 10,000, their total monthly debt obligations, including mortgage payments, cannot exceed SGD 5,500.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          The TDSR framework applies to all housing loans, including loans for the purchase of residential properties, and refinancing loans. For refinancing loans, TDSR is only applicable for investment property loans.
