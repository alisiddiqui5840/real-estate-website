        Felicia Koh is an experienced and innovative interior designer who focuses on putting art and science to work. She loves good design, not just for its own sake but for what it can do for people.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        Interior design is not just a career for Felicia – it’s a passion of 32 years. Her motivation for good designs is the ability to improve individual lives through tiny changes on a massive scale.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        Design doesn’t come out of a need for prettiness but out of the necessity to give form to one’s work. She desires to help clients understand their work by finding a visual language. Her work is based on discussion and insight. It is important to her that the goal is reached together. Design happens when communication gets structured and condensed.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        That is why she likes to collaborate with professionals from different fields, be it local or global.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        Felicia loves meeting interesting and eclectic people and enjoys the variety of experiences that a design career provides. Her design firm, Gallery 278, does more than decorate—its services extend to ones such as furniture leasing to break budget limitations that often hinder the desired look.

          Q1. BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT HOME STAGING?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          One of the biggest misconceptions about home staging is that it is an unnecessary expense. However, not many owners understand that prospective buyers literally give the first 10 seconds to firm up the best first impression when they walk into the development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Home staging helps to highlight the home’s features. It exponentially reduces a property’s time on the market, buyers find it easier to visualize a staged property, and it increases the dollar value offered.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Plus, we help with interior layout advice, and we give a discounted rate off our furniture rental rates when you let us know it will be used for staging purposes.

          Q2. THREE MOST IMPORTANT ACCESSORIES FOR HOME STAGING?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          We hand-pick furnishings from our in-house inventory that will complement each home giving it individuality. We design and space plan to create a seamless journey from room to room that is appealing and inviting to potential buyers. We call this, the poem of space. The rhythm and rhyme are created to have a flow of aesthetic appeal and organic feel.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] font-bold  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          A. DINING TABLE
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Boat or eclipse-shaped dining tables may be unconventional, and a refreshing look can really help to add alternating rhythm to the overall scheme of the space compared to the usual rectangular tables.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Our rounded or chamfered edge dining tables have been popular with home staging (and are kid-friendly, too)!
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] font-bold  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          B. BED
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          A fully dressed bed in the master bedroom also helps create a cosy and homey feel. Dress it up in clean linens and it really makes a big difference to the room with luxurious bedding, Designers Guild accent pillows and bed sashes are my favourites!

          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          We can lease almost anything, including plants. Potted plants and softscapes add a touch of greenery and nature to the home—plants and foliage are always welcome accessories for an understated yet luxuriously spectacular home.

          Q3. WHAT DO YOU ALWAYS SEEK TO IMPROVE FIRST?

          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          As space is premium in Singapore, we always seek to make it look spacious yet full of possibilities with multi-functional furniture that creates a pleasing expression! We have a flexible leasing scheme with a diverse inventory that can complement your existing antique vases or artworks.

          There is also an in-house alterations and carpentry team that can collaborate with you on custom pieces for any ‘nooks or crannies’ that create a value-added fine ambience to your property.
