        Kelvin has been in the interior design/home improvement industry since the beginning of his career. In 2013, Singapore Furniture Rental (SFR) was born as an online furniture rental company.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        Today, SFR has established itself as the No. 1 Home Staging company in Singapore, with over 1,000 units staged in the past three years alone.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        We pride ourselves on being a one-stop service platform for property agents, homeowners, and developers alike. We offer a wide range of services, including furniture rental, home staging, and even property videos.

          Q1. BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT HOME STAGING?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Many people are still unfamiliar with home staging. They might have heard of it but have never used the service before. One of the most common misconceptions is that many people thought that only vacant units could be staged. It is definitely easier to stage a vacant unit, but owner-occupied units can also be staged.

          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Another misconception is that staging is only for photoshoot purposes. In fact, not only is photography included in the home staging package, but the items will also remain in the unit until the property is sold or the lease of staging ends.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          We want the buyers to feel as attracted to the unit when they are in the unit itself, as when they are first attracted to the online listing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] text-[#123774] font-bold   mb-[12px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Q2. THREE MOST IMPORTANT ACCESSORIES FOR HOME STAGING?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Every staging will include carpets, lamps, and art pieces. In a lot of regular homes, you will not find these accessories.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          But when buyers walk into a staged unit with carpets, lamps and art pieces, the staged unit instantly stands out from the rest and looks more welcoming.

          Q3. WHAT DO YOU ALWAYS SEEK TO IMPROVE FIRST?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          We always look at the living and dining areas first. These two areas are usually the first areas buyers walk into when they visit for viewings. We want to make sure these areas are nicely staged to create a positive first impression. Most buyers decide whether they like the unit in the first 15 seconds of stepping into the property.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Therefore, it is very important to stage the living and dining areas.
