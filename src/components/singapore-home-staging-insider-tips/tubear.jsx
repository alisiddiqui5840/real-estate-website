          Q1. BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT HOME STAGING?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Home staging is an expensive marketing tool, and it costs even more to stage a luxury property.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          However, virtual staging is not as expensive as you think. It costs less than traditional home staging while still allowing buyers to visualize living in a space by paying a low, one-time fee per image.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Virtual staging refers to adding realistic, stylish furniture to a listing’s image. It’s quick & easy, and our vast portfolios of furnishings and décor options are not limited to what physical pieces are available to rent. With up-to-date furnishings and accessories, virtual staging is a good option for homes with different layouts & colour schemes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Another misconception is the thinking that staging cannot be done for an occupied unit and that removing unwanted items is a hassle.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          A staged house will stand out above the rest, and better photos will draw a larger group of prospective buyers to view the property and create more interest in offers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Virtual staging and virtual decluttering can be done without sellers moving a single piece of furniture and do not affect their everyday lives.

          Q2. THREE MOST IMPORTANT ACCESSORIES FOR HOME STAGING?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          The 3 most important accessories are carpets, art pieces and plants.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          These accessories help to bring life to the photo making the property look more inviting.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] text-[#123774] font-bold pt-[32px]   mb-[12px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Q3. WHAT DO YOU ALWAYS SEEK TO IMPROVE FIRST?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          The first thing that I will seek to improve will be to declutter the items in the unit.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          A cluttered unit does not showcase the potential of the space. Only by decluttering will one be able to see the layout of the house clearly. Therefore, virtual decluttering helps remove the bulky items in the property to showcase its potential.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Thereafter, add in virtual furniture with virtual staging, to visualise the room before moving in actual furniture, it’s a hassle-free method especially for units in which homeowners who have stayed in for many years & difficult to declutter their items.
