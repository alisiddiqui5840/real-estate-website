        Naazli Somjee is a fourth-generation Singaporean and a US graduate with a double degree in economics and psychology. She started her career in private banking but realised after two years that it was not the job for her.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        She then joined the WTP in 2010 in a sales position, learning about materials and furniture styles. With time, the role evolved into actually designing pieces and sourcing new products from all over the world.
        </p>
        <p className=" text-[17px] text-[#1a202c] mb-[32px]">
        She is always on the lookout for new trends, material combinations, and design ideas.

          Q1. BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT HOME STAGING?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          The biggest misconception about home staging is that homeowners think staging a home is just tidying up and decorating.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]   mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          Home staging is not just that. It highlights the features of the property and, probably most importantly, creates an ambience that can connect with the potential buyer so that they can imagine themselves living in it.

          Q3. WHAT DO YOU ALWAYS SEEK TO IMPROVE FIRST?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          The focus is always the first main living area followed closely by the dining area and master bedroom. The idea is you want to create the wow factor as soon as they step into the house.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px]  mb-[32px] max-w-[650px] mx-auto">
          The goal of staging is to make a home appealing and inviting to as many potential buyers as possible. More than just increase your chances of selling, it is able to increase the value of the sale dramatically.
