          MY JOURNEY TO REAL ESTATE

          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Are you thinking of joining the real estate industry in Singapore?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Full of questions in your head?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          I started thinking (very) seriously about joining the real estate industry in 2009. Back then, I researched online for more information but couldn’t find much “personal” sharing. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          I hope my candid sharing on this page answers your questions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          My background is in Computer Science, which I first studied at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and then at the National University of Singapore.

          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          So, how did I end up in real estate?

          7 CHALLENGES PROPERTY AGENTS FACE
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          What are the most common <a href="#" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[#123774] hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] text-[17px]">challenges new property agents</a> face in Singapore?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Essentially, they face the same challenges that most new business owners face.

          <p className="text-[15px] text-center max-w-[530px] mx-auto mb-[32px]">
          What awaits?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] font-bold text-[#123774] mb-[8px]">
          (A) ESTABLISHING CLIENT BASE
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          New property agents may struggle to find clients and generate leads.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          This is especially true if they don’t have an existing network or referral sources.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          This is probably the biggest challenge for most property agents. Many new PROPERTY agents drop out after 6 to 12 months because they fail to secure enough clients. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] font-bold text-[#123774] mb-[8px]">
          (B) TIME MANAGEMENT
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Balancing prospecting, client meetings, paperwork, and personal life can be overwhelming for new property agents. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          This can be incredibly challenging if you are just married or starting a new family. You will need a supportive and understanding spouse/partner. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          However, explaining to a young kid why you are always away during weekends may be more challenging. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Or when you have to stop playing with him suddenly because you need to close that deal immediately – just like what happened to me. Once. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] font-bold text-[#123774] mb-[8px]">
          (C) INCONSISTENT INCOME
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Our income is 100% commission-based.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          A successful transaction may take months or even years to close. In some cases, the <a href="#" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[#123774] hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] text-[17px]">deals may burst</a> and you would end up with nothing. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          The commission for a successful sale can take between 3 and 24 months to be paid. For rentals, the commission is usually paid when the tenancy agreement has been signed and the tenant has made the necessary payments to the landlord.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          You don’t need a lot of capital to become a property agent. But you need to have enough to tide you till the commission is paid.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Note that the real estate agency (CEA calls Estate Agent) takes a cut of the commission you bring in. This is known as the resale split.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] font-bold text-[#123774] mb-[8px]">
          (D) MASTERING KNOWLEDGE, GAINING EXPERIENCE
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          What they teach in the  <a href="#" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[#123774] hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] text-[17px]">Real Estate Salesperson course</a> is primarily theoretical.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Technical skills, people skills, IT skills, marketing skills, presentation skills, negotiation skills, market knowledge and even navigational skills – once you step onto the field, you will need to build up multiple skill sets to secure and close deals. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          It takes time to learn and master. But it can be done.

          <p className="text-[15px] text-center max-w-[530px] mx-auto mb-[32px]">
          Mastery takes time
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] font-bold text-[#123774] mb-[8px]">
          (E) DEALING WITH REJECTION
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Property agents often face rejection from potential clients or lose deals they’ve been working on.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          This usually feels like personal failure or judgement, even when it’s not intended that way. The emotional sting can be very real for most. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] font-bold text-[#123774] mb-[8px]">
          (F) SELF-DRIVE AND DISCIPLINE
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Unlike the corporate world, you are your own boss when you become a property agent. There is no manager or boss to report to.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          You are answerable to your family & yourself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Your upline isn’t responsible for you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          If you lack the drive & discipline to run your business, no one can push or help you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          Why are you doing this? Who are you doing this for?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] font-bold text-[#123774] mb-[8px]">
          (G) COMPETITION
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px]">
          The real estate industry is super competitive. PERIOD.
