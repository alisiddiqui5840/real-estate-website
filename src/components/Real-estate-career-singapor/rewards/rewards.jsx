            <span className='border border-l-4  border-l-[#2d3748] mr-2'></span>
          Q1. How fast will it take me to close my first deal?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          We are unique in our educational & professional background, our characters, our outlook on life, our resources, our commitment, our motivation and our skill sets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          I would have only met or spoken to you for 5 to 10 minutes. How could I realistically guess the effort, drive and attitude that you are going to put into your business?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          Let me share a story with you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          A fellow property agent (let’s call him, Jim) and I were jointly marketing a vacant 5-storey cluster house for sale.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          When the buyer arrived for the viewing appointment, we spent a few minutes talking to him at the door.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          From the conversation, it was clear to both of us that this buyer wouldn’t be buying the house. He couldn’t quite afford the house.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          Despite this, the buyer expressed a strong desire to go into the property (already vacant) for a house tour. Jim tried to hint to the buyer that there was no point in seeing if he couldn’t afford the house.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          However, I saw things differently.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          Since the buyer was already there and I had set the time aside to conduct the viewing, I was happy to give the buyer a tour of the property. And so I conducted the tour alone.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          Moral of the story?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          There’s no right or wrong. Jim wasn’t wrong. Everyone’s time is precious, and we shouldn’t waste other people’s time. Jim wanted to cut short “his losses.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          Having said that, I’m equally comfortable with my take on the situation. Since the buyer and I were already there, let’s do it. Who knows what opportunity might arise?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          What would you have done in this particular situation?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          I don’t know. Likewise many other unknown situations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          So there’s no way I can answer how fast you can close your first deal. There are rookies who closed their first deal within the first few weeks of getting their licence.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          On the other hand, I’ve also heard a case where the rookie couldn’t close a single deal during her first year.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          Me? It took me <a href="#" className="underline underline-offset-4 hover:no-underline transition duration-200 ease-in-out text-[#123774] hover:bg-[#123774] hover:text-[#ffffff] text-[17px]">three months</a>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
            <span className='border border-l-4  border-l-[#2d3748] mr-2'></span>
            Q2. How much can I make?
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          The simple answer is how much you can make is really up to you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          The highest earners in the industry easily make more than a million dollars a year.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          Having said that, the truth is not everyone who comes into this line succeeds.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          The turnover rate is very high because most people give up too quickly. They entered the industry without the right mindset and drive.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] mb-[32px] ">
          What kind of mindset do you feel is required to do well in this line?
          </p>
